# simple-site
A simple, markdown-based website.

This is a place for me to test out a very simple method of deploying a static HTML site with pages written in markdown. Think like Jekyll or Hugo but much "dumber".

The demo site can be found [here][demo site] and is completely unstyled and has no javascript.

For my actual website source see [this repo][1].

## How it works

1. Fork this repo
2. Turn on GitHub Actions for this repo: In the settings page of the new repo, go to Pages and ensure github pages is on, and the source is set to "Github Actions"
3. Turn on the Github Action workflow for this repo: In the settings page, go to Actions > General, and select "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
    - **Note**: you can review this workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder.
4. Put your markdown files in `./markdown`, make sure they end with `.md`
5. Replace the `favicon.ico` of my face with your own, or delete it
6. Change `SITE_ROOT` in `./env` to match where your site will be served
7. Commit and push


If you don't want the generated breadcrumbs, change (or delete) `CRUMBS` in `./env`.

**Note**: If your markdown file starts with a H1 header, That header will also be used as the title of the page.

## Custom CSS and Javascript

For those of you who really want to feel the pain, put your css in `./css/base.css` and your javascript in `./js/main.js`.
Both will get deployed with your static site and loaded for every page. Similarly, make sure they end with `.css` and `.js`,
respectively.

There is a `perfect5th.css` file in the `css` folder you can move the contents into `base.css` to have some basic styles.

If you need more than one file, either get clever or edit `./templates/base.html` or `./templates/close.html`.

## Testing locally

Make sure you have `markdown` installed. You can get it from [the Markdown Homepage][2] or your favourite package manager probably.
Make sure you have a POSIX shell of some kind.

Execute `./convert.sh`, which builds your site in `_site`. You can then serve this directory however you see fit â€“ use the `file://`
protocol in your browser or a simple server like `python3 -m http.server`.

Things I may or may not do:
  * templates, or at least a bit more customization
  * github pages serving (DONE)
  * javascript (gasp) (DONE)
  * css (DONE)
  * tbd
